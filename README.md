# parrot

## Introduction

Parrot is a hands-on project for learning about programming language implementation. It is inspired by the book ["Writing A Compiler In Go"](https://compilerbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. The project will involve building an interpreter, virtual machine, pattern matching and logic programming system, and more - echoing the concept of a parrot learning, mimicking and emulating programming language features through practice.

## Features

Here we explore a variety of concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Interpreters**: Explore the implementation of interpreters for different programming languages.
- **Virtual Machines**: Study and build virtual machines to execute code efficiently.
- **Pattern Matching**: Learn about pattern matching techniques and their applications.
- **Logic Programming**: Dive into the world of logic programming (e.g., Prolog) and its underlying principles.
